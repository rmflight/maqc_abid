## Abstract

Background:
Current transcriptomics analyses are hampered by an inability to easily convert between various types of identifiers,
making it difficult to easily compare the results of studies performed using different types of platforms. AbsIDConvert,
a tool recently developed by the Rouchka group, makes interconversion of identifiers possible by mapping each type of
identifier to a genomic interval, and using overlapping intervals as the basis for the conversion. Using the MicroArray
Quality Control (MAQC) dataset as an example, this work will demonstrate how the agreement between different experiments 
changes depending on how the platform specific identifiers are converted to allow comparison.

Methodology:
Three types of conversions will be utilized to enable comparison of the data:
 1 - Manufacterer supplied probe annotations to Entrez Gene and Refseq Transcripts
 * - AbsIDConvert based conversion to Entrez Gene and Refseq Transcripts
 * - Direct overlap of the defined genomic intervals for each probe.
For each conversion, the correlation of the signal intensities for matching probes will be investigated, as well as the
rank of probes (using log fold change and p-value) after testing for differential expression between two conditions.

Results: 
AbsIDConvert was used to compare the intensities and ranks of probes measured in the MAQC dataset on the Affymetrix(r) 
and Agilent(r) one color platforms. Agreement between the platforms was found to improve as the different methodologies
to define the **same** measurement were modified, with **1** having the least agreement, and **3** having the best
agreement between the two platforms. This demonstrates that using genomic intervals as a basis for inter-platform comparisons
is reliable, and improves the reproducibility of results obtained by multiple high-throughput genomics platforms.

## Introduction

*Need a bunch of stuff here about why this is so important*

### Data

[MicroArray Quality Control (MAQC)][maqcRef1] project data. This work uses the [Affymetrix(r)][affyDataDownload] and 
[Agilent(r)][agilentDataDownload] one color array data from one location. Both types of arrays were hybridized to the same
set of mRNA samples (A & B), thereby providing two samples to compare average intensities, as well as allowing the 
calculation of differential expression between the samples.

#### Read in Data

```{r readAffy}
affyDir <- "GSE5350_MAQC_AFX_123456_120CELs"
nRep <- 5
pDat <- data.frame(Sample=c(rep("A",nRep), rep("B", nRep)))
fileNames <- paste(rep("AFX_1",nRep*2), c(rep("_A", nRep), rep("_B", nRep)), seq(1, nRep), ".CEL", sep="" )
affyCel <- ReadAffy(filenames=fileNames, celfile.path=affyDir, phenoData=pDat)
arrayQualityMetrics(expressionset=affyCel, outdir="affyQuality", do.logtransform=T, force=T)
```


```{r readAgilent}
agilDir <- "GSE5350_MAQC_AG1_123_60TXTs"
nRep <- 5
fileNames <- paste(rep("AG1_1",nRep*2), c(rep("_A", nRep), rep("_B", nRep)), seq(1, nRep), ".txt", sep="" )
agilDat <- read.maimages(files=fileNames, path=agilDir, green.only=T, source="agilent")
agilBack <- backgroundCorrect(agilDat, method="normexp")
agilNorm <- normalizeBetweenArrays(agilBack, method="quantile")
agilForQuality <- ExpressionSet(agilNorm$E)
arrayQualityMetrics(expressionset=agilForQuality, outdir="agilQuality", do.logtransform=F, force=T)
rm(agilForQuality)
```

## Manufacturer Mappings

For both the Affymetrix(r) and Agilent(r) data, generate summary values based on the mappings supplied
by the manufacturer to Refseq transcript and Entrez gene. 

```{r getAffySignal}
affyNorm <- rma(affyCel)
affyEset <- exprs(affyNorm)
keepAffy <- grep("^AFFX", row.names(affyEset), invert=T)
affyEset <- affyEset[keepAffy,] # got rid of the control probes
```

```{r getAgilentSignal}
notControl <- agilNorm$genes$ControlType == 0
spotID <- rownames(agilNorm$genes[notControl,])

agilEset <- agilNorm$E[notControl,]
row.names(agilEset) <- spotID
```

```{r getMaps}
affyMap <- read.table("GPL570-13270.txt", header=T, skip=16, sep="\t", quote="", strip.white=T)
keepAffyMap <- grep("^AFFX", affyMap$ID, invert=T)
affyMap <- affyMap[keepAffyMap,]

agilMap <- read.table("GPL1708-20418.txt", header=T, skip=20, sep="\t", quote="", comment.char="", strip.white=T)
agilMap <- agilMap[(agilMap$CONTROL_TYPE == FALSE),]
```

### Gene

Using the manufacturer annotations of probe ID to gene, assign probes and probesets to Entrez genes, and then generate an average intensity for all the probe (sets) annotated to that gene, as well as across the condition.

```{r affySignal}
affyE1 <- findSingle(affyMap$ENTREZ_GENE_ID, "///")
affyE1 <- affyMap[affyE1, c("ID", "ENTREZ_GENE_ID")]
affyEset <- affyEset[(row.names(affyEset) %in% affyE1$ID),]

affyAvgEnt <- calcAverageGene(affyE1, "ID", "ENTREZ_GENE_ID", affyEset)
affyAvgEnt.A <- apply(affyAvgEnt[,pDat$Sample=="A"], 1, mean)
affyAvgEnt.B <- apply(affyAvgEnt[,pDat$Sample == "B"], 1, mean)
```

```{r agilSignal}
agilEntMap <- agilMap[, c("ID", "GENE")]
agilEntMap <- sapply(names(agilEntMap), function(x){as.character(agilEntMap[,x])})
agilAvgEnt <- calcAverageGene(agilEntMap, "ID", "GENE", agilEset)
```
